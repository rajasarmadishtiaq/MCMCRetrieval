# Probabilistic Knowledge Graph Retrieval
**Research Sandbox**: Experimental implementation of a RAG system that uses MCMC and Ant Colony Optimization to traverse knowledge graphs.
**File:** `mcmc-retrieval.ipynb` contains the graph construction, the search algorithms & comparison on a demo document.
